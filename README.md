Project Description: Beer-Api


The present project is a React application designed for beer enthusiasts. The application offers various features and views related to beer, allowing users to view beer details, display random beers, and browse through a list of all available beers. Here's an overview of the key components and features of the project:

Technology Stack:

The project is built using React.js for front-end development.
React Router is used for routing.
The application utilizes modern web technologies like Flexbox for layout and CSS for styling.


Routing with React Router:

The application uses React Router to enable navigation between different pages.
Routing configuration is defined in the App.js file.


Dynamic Data Binding:

The application fetches beer data from an external API (https://ih-beers-api2.herokuapp.com/beers) and dynamically displays it.


Style and Design:

Home Page (Home):

The home page presents two primary actions: "All Beers" and "Random Beer."
Users can click on these actions to view all available beers or a random beer.
Displaying All Beers (AllBeers):

This page displays all available beers in a list.
Each beer is presented with an image, name, slogan, and producer.
Users can click on "Details" to view more information about a specific beer.
Displaying Beer Details (AllBeerDetails):

This page shows detailed information about a selected beer.
Information such as name, slogan, first brewed year, attenuation level, and beer description is displayed.
Users can also return to the previous page via a link.
Displaying a Random Beer (RandomList):

This page displays a randomly selected beer with detailed information.
Users can click "Back" to return to the home page.
Navigation (NavBar):

The navigation bar at the top of each page includes a logo and allows users to return to the home page.
This project provides an excellent opportunity to learn and apply React.js and React Router in practice. It offers an intuitive user interface for exploring beer details and can serve as a starting point for developing similar applications.
